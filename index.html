            <p class="portfolio-description">Driven Honours student at the University of Amsterdam with a keen interest in New Media and Digital Technologies. My leadership within the Amsterdam Honours Student Council showcases my dedication to fostering community and enhancing student experiences. From co-founding Fij_Store to navigating my exchange at Fordham University, I bring a blend of entrepreneurial spirit, resilience, and global perspective. I am passionate about using my journey to inspire and guide others in the realms of media and student engagement. This website is a showcase of my digital production work for new media, a journey I thoroughly enjoyed from filming to editing.</p>
