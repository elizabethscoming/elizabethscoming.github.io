            <h2>Alone Among Millions: An Exchange Student in the Big Apple</h2>
            <p>In this documentary, we dive into the everyday lives of Lamia from Bangladesh and Capucine from France, two exchange students at Fordham University in New York City. Their stories provide a genuine glimpse into the often-unspoken realities of international students on a campus where they are a minority.
            We are focusing on the aspects of their experience that usually stay under the radar - how they navigate friendship, adjust to an entirely new environment, and handle the day-to-day challenges of life in a bustling city.
            Lamia and Capucine's narrative is raw and sincere. They openly discuss the hardships, such as feelings of isolation or homesickness, which are as much a part of their journey as the breakthroughs and joys. They also share positive experiences â€“ forming new friendships, discovering different cultures, and learning in an environment miles away from home.
            This film is more than just a university tale; it is an intimate exploration of adapting to new circumstances, finding your place in an unfamiliar setting, and the unique experiences that shape international students. It is about the highs and lows, the unexpected lessons, and the personal growth that comes with studying abroad.</p>
